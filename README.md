# Tic-Tac-Toe-python
This is a Python version of the game Tic Tac Toe, which I originally wrote in Cpp and translated to Python.
The intent is to practice both programming languages as a first project in both.
The code implements some OOP principles as the game uses a class to manage the game board and check for wins.
